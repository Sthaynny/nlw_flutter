<p align="center">Project developed during the <strong>Chapter III</strong> of Ignite | <a href="https://rocketseat.com.br/">Rocketseat</a></p>

<hr />

<p align="center">In this project, I learned very important concepts from Next.js, like Server Side Rendering, Static Site Generation, API Routes, integration with Stripe, an internet payment infrastructure, webhooks with Stripe, data persistence in FaunaDB, a non-relational database focused on serverless, authentication with GitHub using Next Auth and best practices in css using Sass.
